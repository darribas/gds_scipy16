# Software and Tools Installation

## Dependencies

Participants should have installed the following dependencies:

* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) or
  [MiniConda](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html) Python distributions for
  Python 2.7. See installation instructions on the links.
* `git`
* A `conda` environment loaded with all the dependencies can be installed by
  running the `pydata.sh` script available as part of the `envs` repository
  ([Github link](https://github.com/darribas/envs)). To install it, follow
  these instructions:
    
    - Clone the repository on your machine: 
    
    `> git clone https://github.com/darribas/envs.git`

    - Navigate into the folder:

    `> cd envs`

    - Run the script:

    `> bash pydata.sh`

Once installed, you need to activate the environment to run the notebooks. In
Windows, open up [PowerShell](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell) and
type:

`> activate pydata`

And if you are on GNU/Linux or OSX:

`> source activate pydata`
